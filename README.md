## Data Analysis Process    
### Ask:  
The "ask" phase of the data analysis process involves recognizing the current problem, understanding stakeholder expectations, defining the business task, and identifying how insights will benefit stakeholders.  

**Business Task:**  
Analyze the 2023 annual sales report to gain insights that will guide the company in understanding its customer base and help drive sales growth in 2024.  

**Key Stakeholders**  
The key stakeholders for this project include:

- Ananya Store Analytics team: A team of data analysts responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Ananya Store’s business strategy  

**To address the business task of analyzing the annual sales report for 2023 to understand the company's customer base and help drive sales growth in 2024, the following questions will guide the analysis:**    
- Compare the sales and orders using single chart    
- Which month got the highest sales and orders    
- Who purchased more: men or women in 2023   
- What are different order status in 2023    
- List top 10 states contributing to the sales  
- Relation between age and gender based on number of orders    
- Which channel is contributing to maximum sales  
- Highest selling category?, etc.

### Prepare:  
The "prepare" phase of the data analysis process involves collecting and preparing the necessary data for analysis. Key steps include identifying data sources such as databases, spreadsheets, or external sources, and then extracting the relevant information.      

Ananya Mishra, owner and Chief Creative Officer of Ananya Store, encourages the use of the 2023 annual sales report, which includes information about orders, customers, shipments, and channels. The dataset is in XLSX format and contains 19 columns, including Index, Order ID, Cust ID, Gender, Age, Date, Status, Channel, SKU, Category, Size, Qty, Currency, Amount, Ship City, Ship State, Ship Postal Code, Ship Country, and B2B.
